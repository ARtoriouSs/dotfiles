# Scripts

Installation scripts must be executed with sudo.

### Explanations:

- [prepare_system.sh](prepare_system.sh) - prepare recently installed system. It will also execute all other scripts here.
- [create_symlinks.sh](create_symlinks.sh) - add symlinks for all dotfiles in this repo, so they can store in one place.
- [create_dir_tree.sh](create_dir_tree.sh) - create some directories for convenience.
