# Dotfiles

This is repo with my system configuration.

You can find something useful here and add it to your system. See source files or [README in scripts/](scripts) for help.

## Or you can install everything

*NOTE:* Implied all dotfiles stored in `$HOME/dotfiles` directory and have a symlinks in `$HOME`. So you can manage and commit them from one place.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ARtoriouSs/dotfiles.git
  ./dotfiles/scripts/prepare_system.sh
```

Also see [README in scripts/](scripts) if you don't need something.
